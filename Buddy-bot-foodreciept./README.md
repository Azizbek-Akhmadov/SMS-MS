# ROS NODE

In the above code, I create a MealRecommendationNode class that initializes the ROS node, subscribes to the 'customer_preferences' topic to receive customer preferences, and publishes the recommended meal on the 'meal_recommendation' topic.

To implement the generate_recommendation() method based on our recommendation algorithm. This method takes in the customer preferences as input and returns the recommended meal. Replace the placeholder logic in the example with my own recommendation logic.

 'Spaghetti Bolognese' with the actual meal recommendation generated by my algorithm.

I created a ROS package, add this script to the package's scripts directory, and make it executable. Then, launched the ROS node using rosrun or include it in a launch file along with other necessary nodes.

 Publish customer preferences to the 'customer_preferences' topic, and the node will generate the meal recommendation and publish it on the 'meal_recommendation' topic. I can subscribe to the 'meal_recommendation' topic in another node to receive the recommendations and further process them or display them to the user.
 
 # ReceiptGenerationNode
 
 I created a ReceiptGenerationNode class that initializes the ROS node and subscribes to the 'selected_items' topic to receive the selected meal items.

The generate_receipt() method is called whenever selected items are received. It splits the selected items string into a list of items, calculates the total cost using the calculate_total_cost() method, and generates a digital receipt using the generate_digital_receipt() method. The receipt is then logged to the console, but you can modify it to publish the receipt to another topic or use it as per your application requirements.

To implement the get_item_cost() method based on your logic to retrieve the cost of an individual item. This method takes in an item name and returns its cost.

Item names and their costs in the get_item_cost() method based on my database or source of item information.

To use this code, created a ROS package, add this script to the package's scripts directory, and make it executable. Then, launch the ROS node using rosrun or include it in a launch file along with other necessary nodes.

Publish the selected items as a comma-separated string to the 'selected_items' topic, and the node will calculate the total cost and generate a digital receipt.
