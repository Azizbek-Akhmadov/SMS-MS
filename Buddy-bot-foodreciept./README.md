# ROS NODE

In the above code, I create a MealRecommendationNode class that initializes the ROS node, subscribes to the 'customer_preferences' topic to receive customer preferences, and publishes the recommended meal on the 'meal_recommendation' topic.

To implement the generate_recommendation() method based on our recommendation algorithm. This method takes in the customer preferences as input and returns the recommended meal. Replace the placeholder logic in the example with my own recommendation logic.

 'Spaghetti Bolognese' with the actual meal recommendation generated by my algorithm.

I created a ROS package, add this script to the package's scripts directory, and make it executable. Then, launched the ROS node using rosrun or include it in a launch file along with other necessary nodes.

 Publish customer preferences to the 'customer_preferences' topic, and the node will generate the meal recommendation and publish it on the 'meal_recommendation' topic. I can subscribe to the 'meal_recommendation' topic in another node to receive the recommendations and further process them or display them to the user.
